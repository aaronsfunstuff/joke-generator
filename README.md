# Random Joke Generator

## Overview
The Random Joke Generator is a simple web application that displays a random joke each time the user clicks a button. It also allows users to view an archive of previously shown jokes and submit their own jokes for consideration.

## Features
- **Random Joke Display**: Click the "Get a Joke" button to display a random joke from a predefined list.
- **Joke Archive**: Visit the [Joke Archive](archive.html) to see all jokes that have been displayed so far.
- **Submit a Joke**: Use the [Submit a Joke](submit.html) form to submit your favorite jokes to be potentially featured on the website.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Provides the structure and content of the website.
- **CSS**: Styles the layout and visual elements to create a modern and user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the functionality to generate random jokes and manage user interactions.
- **GitHub Pages**: Used for hosting the website and making it publicly accessible.

## How It Works
The website uses a JavaScript function to randomly select a joke from an array of predefined jokes. Each time the user clicks the "Get a Joke" button, a new joke is displayed dynamically on the page without reloading the entire webpage. The archive page lists all jokes shown so far, allowing users to revisit their favorites. The submit page enables users to contribute their own jokes, enhancing the diversity and humor of the content.

## Development Process
- **HTML Structure**: Created the basic layout including header, main content area, and footer.
- **CSS Styling**: Applied styles to improve the visual appeal and user experience.
- **JavaScript Logic**: Developed functions to handle joke generation, display, and management.
- **Testing and Refinement**: Tested the website across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement user authentication to allow registered users to submit jokes.
- Add social media sharing buttons for users to easily share jokes they enjoy.
- Incorporate a rating system for users to vote on their favorite jokes.
